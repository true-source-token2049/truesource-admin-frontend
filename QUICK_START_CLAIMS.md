# Quick Start: Testing the NFT Claim System

This guide will walk you through testing the approval-based NFT claim system from start to finish.

## Prerequisites

- MetaMask installed and connected to Sepolia testnet
- Sepolia ETH in your wallet (get from https://sepoliafaucet.com)
- Contracts deployed (EditableNFT and NFTClaimContract)
- Environment variables configured in `.env.local`

## Step-by-Step Testing Guide

### Phase 1: Setup (5 minutes)

#### 1. Deploy Contracts
```bash
# Deploy NFT contract
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-editable-nft.cjs --network sepolia

# Copy the contract address and add to .env.local
# NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x...

# Deploy claim contract
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-claim-contract.cjs --network sepolia

# Copy the claim contract address and add to .env.local
# NEXT_PUBLIC_CLAIM_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x...
```

#### 2. Start the App
```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit http://localhost:3000

### Phase 2: Retailer Setup (10 minutes)

#### 3. Connect as Retailer
- Open MetaMask
- Connect to the app on Sepolia network
- This wallet will act as the "retailer"

#### 4. Mint an NFT
- Go to "Mint New NFT" page
- Upload an image (try a product photo)
- Enter name: "Test Product NFT"
- Enter description: "This NFT proves ownership of Product #123"
- Set quantity: 1
- Click "Mint NFT" and confirm in MetaMask
- **Note the Token ID** (e.g., Token ID: 1)

#### 5. Approve the NFT for Claims
- Go to "Retailer Claims Management" page
- Enter the Token ID you just minted (e.g., 1)
- Click "Check Approval" - should show "‚ö†Ô∏è This NFT needs approval first"
- Click "‚úì Approve NFT for Claims"
- Confirm the transaction in MetaMask
- Wait for confirmation
- You should see: "‚úÖ NFT approved successfully!"

#### 6. Create a Claim Code
- Click "üé≤ Generate Random Code" (e.g., CLAIM-ABC123XYZ)
- Or enter your own code
- Click "‚úì Create Claim Code"
- Confirm the transaction in MetaMask
- Wait for confirmation
- **Copy the claim code** - you'll share this with the customer

### Phase 3: Customer Claims (5 minutes)

#### 7. Switch to Customer Wallet
You have two options:

**Option A: Use a different wallet**
- Create a new MetaMask account
- Get some Sepolia ETH for gas

**Option B: Use the same wallet (for testing)**
- Just continue with the same wallet
- In production, this would be a different person's wallet

#### 8. Claim the NFT
- Go to "Claim Your NFT" page
- Connect wallet (as the customer)
- Enter the claim code you copied earlier
- Click "Verify Code"
- You should see:
  - ‚úÖ Valid claim code!
  - NFT details (image, name, description, token ID)
- Click "üéÅ Claim NFT Now!"
- Confirm the transaction in MetaMask
- Wait for confirmation
- You should see: "üéâ Success! NFT claimed successfully!"

#### 9. Verify the Transfer
- Go to "View & Edit NFTs" page
- Enter the Token ID
- Check the owner address - it should now be the customer's wallet!
- View the NFT history page to see the transfer event

### Phase 4: Test Edge Cases (5 minutes)

#### 10. Try Using the Same Code Again
- Go back to "Claim Your NFT"
- Enter the same claim code
- Click "Verify Code"
- You should see: "‚ùå This claim code has already been used"
- This proves each code works only once!

#### 11. Test Canceling a Claim
- As the retailer, mint another NFT (Token ID: 2)
- Approve it for claims
- Create a claim code (e.g., CLAIM-TEST456)
- **Before anyone claims it**, go to the "Cancel a Claim" section
- Enter the claim code
- Click "Cancel Claim"
- Confirm in MetaMask
- Now try to claim with that code - should fail!

#### 12. Test Invalid Code
- Go to "Claim Your NFT"
- Enter a random code like "INVALID-CODE"
- Click "Verify Code"
- You should see: "‚ùå Invalid claim code"

## Testing Checklist

Use this checklist to ensure everything works:

- [ ] NFT contract deployed
- [ ] Claim contract deployed
- [ ] Environment variables configured
- [ ] App running on localhost:3000
- [ ] Connected wallet to Sepolia
- [ ] Minted at least one NFT
- [ ] Approved NFT for claim contract
- [ ] Created claim code
- [ ] Shared code (or copied for testing)
- [ ] Customer claimed NFT successfully
- [ ] NFT transferred to customer wallet
- [ ] Tried using same code again (should fail)
- [ ] Tested canceling a claim
- [ ] Tested invalid claim code

## Expected Results

### ‚úÖ Success Indicators
- Retailer approves NFT with one signature
- Claim code created on-chain
- Customer claims without retailer involvement
- NFT transfers instantly to customer
- Used codes can't be claimed again
- Canceled codes can't be claimed
- Invalid codes are rejected

### ‚ùå Common Issues

**Issue: "Contract not approved for this NFT"**
- Solution: Make sure you clicked "Approve NFT for Claims" first

**Issue: "Claim code already exists"**
- Solution: Each code must be unique. Generate a new one.

**Issue: "You don't own this NFT"**
- Solution: Make sure you're using the retailer's wallet that owns the NFT

**Issue: "Invalid claim code"**
- Solution: Double-check the claim code. It's case-sensitive.

**Issue: "Please switch to Sepolia network"**
- Solution: Open MetaMask and switch to Sepolia testnet

**Issue: Transaction fails**
- Solution: Ensure you have enough Sepolia ETH for gas fees

## Real-World Simulation

### Scenario: Sneaker Store with NFT Authenticity Certificates

1. **Retailer (Sneaker Store)**
   - Mints 10 NFTs, one for each pair of limited edition sneakers
   - Approves all 10 NFTs for the claim contract (10 transactions)
   - Creates 10 unique claim codes (10 transactions)
   - Prints QR codes with claim codes on shoe boxes

2. **Customer 1 buys Sneaker #1**
   - Scans QR code to get claim code
   - Goes to claim portal
   - Claims NFT instantly (no waiting for retailer!)

3. **Customers 2-10 buy remaining sneakers**
   - Each scans their QR code
   - Each claims their NFT instantly
   - All happen simultaneously - no bottleneck!

4. **Result**
   - Retailer signed: 20 transactions total (10 approvals + 10 claim codes)
   - Without claim system: Would need 30 transactions (10 mints + 10 approvals + 10 transfers)
   - More importantly: Transfers happen instantly without retailer being online!

## Next Steps

After successful testing:

1. **For Development:**
   - Integrate claim code generation with your existing order system
   - Add QR code generation for claim codes
   - Set up email notifications with claim codes
   - Add claim code analytics dashboard

2. **For Production:**
   - Deploy contracts to mainnet
   - Update environment variables
   - Test thoroughly on mainnet
   - Implement additional security measures (rate limiting, etc.)
   - Set up monitoring and alerts

3. **For Users:**
   - Create customer-facing documentation
   - Design claim code delivery method (email, QR, etc.)
   - Set up customer support for claim issues
   - Monitor claim success rates

## Troubleshooting

### Check Contract Deployment
```bash
# Verify contracts are deployed
npx hardhat verify --network sepolia <NFT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS>
npx hardhat verify --network sepolia <CLAIM_CONTRACT_ADDRESS> <NFT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS>
```

### Check Approval Status
```javascript
// In browser console
const provider = new ethers.BrowserProvider(window.ethereum);
const nft = new ethers.Contract(NFT_ADDRESS, ['function getApproved(uint256) view returns (address)'], provider);
const approved = await nft.getApproved(tokenId);
console.log('Approved address:', approved);
```

### Check Claim Status
```javascript
// In browser console
const provider = new ethers.BrowserProvider(window.ethereum);
const claim = new ethers.Contract(CLAIM_ADDRESS, ['function checkClaim(string) view returns (bool, uint256, address, bool)'], provider);
const [isValid, tokenId, retailer, isClaimed] = await claim.checkClaim('CLAIM-ABC123');
console.log({ isValid, tokenId: tokenId.toString(), retailer, isClaimed });
```

## Success! üéâ

If you've completed all the steps, you've successfully:
- ‚úÖ Deployed an approval-based NFT claim system
- ‚úÖ Approved NFTs for automated transfers
- ‚úÖ Created secure, one-time claim codes
- ‚úÖ Enabled customers to claim NFTs instantly
- ‚úÖ Eliminated the need for retailers to sign each transfer

- Review the frontend code in `app/retailer-claims/` and `app/customer-claim/`

## Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the browser console for errors
